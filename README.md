# Budget-trackers

## My motivation for this project was to add functionality to the starting code (given to us by the Bootcamp), specifically utilizing indexedDB, in order to allow offline acces and funcitonality to the online/offline budget trackers.  

#### I built this project, in part, to showcase my understanding of how to add back end code to exisiting front end code using indexedDB and then deploying it via Heroku using MongoAtlas.  

#### This application solves the problem often of how to complete a full stack web application that can store and then retrieve data if the network connection is lost/regained, using indexedDB.

#### In this project, I learned more about Mongoose, MongoDB, MongoAtlas and indexedDB.

#### Please see the screenshot below for a preview of the UI:
